### Logistic and Linear Regression in Python

Performing **logistic** regression in Python using:
- `regplot` function from the seaborn library
- `GLM` (Generalized Linear Models) with Binomial family and Logit (default) link from the statsmodels library
- `Logit` function from the statsmodels library
- `LogisticRegression` from the scikit-learn library

Bootstrap method application is demonstrated for the purpose of estimating confidence intervals on logistic regression coefficients and predictions.

Performing **linear** regression in Python using:
- `regplot` function from the seaborn library
- `OLS` (Ordinary Least Squares) from the statsmodels library
- `LinearRegression` from the scikit-learn library

Bootstrap method application is demonstrated for the purpose of estimating confidence intervals on linear regression coefficients and predictions.
